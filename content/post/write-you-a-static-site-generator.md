> My talk for the NodeJS Dublin Meetup, [April 2018](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Node-js-Meetup/events/249736007/) ⚡️

**Description:** The JAM stack has become a popular way of developing sites.
In this talk, I will go through the process of building a static site generator.
I will talk about the choices to make when designing your own, why NodeJS is well suited for this, and will cover actually writing one in the talk.
Lastly, I will discuss the current state of the JAM stack, and when you should think about using it.

**Rough Talk Duration:** 30-40 minutes
