Hello! Welcome, welcome, it's great to have you here!
Today we're going to be building a really simple Javascript module bundler!

Before we start, I want to give a few acknowledgements, for which this source is heavily based on.

* [Unbundling the JavaScript module bundler](http://loige.link/bundle-dublinjs) - Luciano Mammino
* [Minipack](https://github.com/ronami/minipack) - Ronen Amiel

Okay, lets get started with what a module bundler actually is!

## What's A Module Bundler?

You may have used tools such as Browserify, Webpack, Rollup or one of many others, but a module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of javascript and takes them and their dependencies and makes it into a single file, usually for use in the browser.

It usually starts with an entry file, and from their bundles up all of the code needed for that entry file.

![A Diagram Of Bundling](/images/what-is-a-bundler.png)

There are 2 main stages of a bundler:

1. Dependency resolution
2. Packing

Starting from an entry point (above it's `main.js`), the goal of dependency resolution is to look for all of the dependencies of your code - that is, other pieces of code that it needs to function - and construct a graph (called a dependency graph) like the above.

Once this is done, you can then pack, or convert your dependency graph into a single file that you can use.

Let's start out our code with some imports (I will give the reasoning later) 

```js
const detective = require('detective')
const resolve = require('resolve').sync
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
```

## Dependency Resolution

The first thing we have to do is think up how we want to represent a module during the dependency resolution phase.

### Module Representation

We are going to need four things:

* The name and an identifier of the file
* Where the file came from (in the file system)
* The code in the file
* What dependencies that file needs.

The graph structure gets built up through the recursive 'what dependencies'.

In Javascript, the easiest way to represent such a set of data would be an object, so thats what's gonna happen.

```js
let ID = 0
function createModuleObject(filepath) {
  const source = fs.readFileSync(filepath, 'utf-8')
  const requires = detective(source)
  const id = ID++

  return { id, filepath, source, requires }
}
```

Looking at this `createDependencyObject` function, the notable part is the call to a function called `detective`.

Detective is a library that can "Find all calls to require() no matter how deeply nested", and using it means we can avoid doing our own AST traversal!

One thing to note (and this is the same in almost all module bundlers), if you try to do something weird like

```
const libName = 'lodash'
const lib = require(libName)
```

It will not be able to find it (because that would mean executing the code).

So what does running this function on the path of a module give?

Whats next?
Dependency resolution!!1!11!!!1!

Okay, not quite yet - I first want to talk about a thing called a module map.

### Module Map

When you import modules in node, you can do relative imports, like `require('./utils')`. So when your code calls this, how does the bundler know what is the right './utils' file when everything is packaged?

That is the problem the module map solves.

Our module object has a unique `id` key which will be our 'source of truth'. So when we are doing our dependency resolution, for each module, we will keep a list of the names of what is being required along with their id, so we can get the correct module at runtime.

This also means we can store all of the modules in a non-nested object, using the id as a key!

![Modules Map](/images/modules-map.png)

### Dependency Resolution

```js
function getModules(entry) {
  const rootModule = createModuleObject(entry)
  const modules = [rootModule]

  // Iterate over the modules, even when new 
  // ones are being added
  for (const module of modules) {
    module.map = {} // Where we will keep the module maps

    module.requires.forEach(dependency => {
      const basedir = path.dirname(module.filepath)
      const dependencyPath = resolve(dependency, { basedir })

      const dependencyObject = createModuleObject(dependencyPath)

      module.map[dependency] = dependencyObject.id
      modules.push(dependencyObject)
    })
  }

  return modules
}
```

Okay, so there is a fair amount going on in the `getModules` function.
It's main purpose is to start at the root/entry module, and look for and resolve dependencies recursively.

What do I mean by 'resolve dependencies'?
In node there is a thing called the `require.resolve`, and it's how node figures out where the file that you are requiring is. This is because we can import relatively or from a `node_modules` folder.

Lucky for us, there's an npm module named `resolve` which implements this algorithm for us! We just have to pass in the argument that would be for require and the base url, and it will do all the hard work for us :)

So we are doing this resolution for each dependency of each module in the project.

We are also creating that modules map `map` that I mentioned earlier.

At the end of the function, we are left with an array named `modules` which will contain module objects for every module/dependency in our project!

Now that we have that, we can move on to the final step, packing!


## Packing

In the browser there is no such thing as modules (kind of), but that means there is no require function, and no `module.exports`, so even though we have all of our dependencies, we currently have no way to use them as modules.

### Module Factory Function

Enter the factory function. 

A factory function is a function (that's not a constructor) which returns an object.
It is a pattern from object oriented programming, and one of its uses is to do encapsulation and dependency injection.

Sound good?

Using a factory function, we can both inject our own `require` function and `module.exports` object that can be used in our bundled code and give the module it's own scope.

```
// A factory function
(require, module) => {
  /* Module Source */
}
```

### Packing 

I am now going to show you the `pack` function, and I will explain the rest after.

```js
function pack(modules) {
  const modulesSource = modules.map(module => 
    `${module.id}: {
      factory: (module, require) => {
        ${module.source}
      },
      map: ${JSON.stringify(module.map)}
    }`
  ).join()

  return `(modules => {
    const require = id => {
      const { factory, map } = modules[id]
      const localRequire = name => require(map[name])
      const module = { exports: {} }

      factory(module, localRequire)

      return module.exports
    }

    require(0)
  })({ ${modulesSource} })`
}
```

Most of that is just template literals of javascript, so let's discuss what it's doing.

First up is `modulesSource`. Here, we are going through each of the modules and transforming it into a string of source.

So what is the output like for a module object?

![packing](/images/packing.png)

Now it's a little hard to read, but you can see that the source is encapsulated and we are providing `modules` and `require` using the factory function as I mentioned before.

We are also including the modules map that we constructed during the dependency resolution.

Next in the function we join all of these up to create a big object of all the dependencies.

The next string of code is an IIFE, which means when you run that code in the browser (or anywhere else), the function will be ran immediately. IIFE is another pattern for encapsulating scope, and is used here to so we don't polute the global scope with our `require` and `modules.

You can see that we are defining two require functions, `require` and `localRequire`.

Require accepts the id of a module object, but of course the source code isn't written using ids, we are using the other function `localRequire` to take any arguments to require by the modules and convert them to the correct id. 
This is using those module maps!

After this, we are defining a `module object` that the module can populate, and passing both functions into the factory, after which we return `module.exports`.

Lastly, we call `require(0)` to require the module with an id of 0, being our entry file.

And thats it!
That is our module bundler 100% complete!

```js
module.exports = entry => pack(getModules(entry))
```

## And That's It ðŸŽ‰

So we now have a working module bundler.

Now this probably shouldn't be used in production, because it's missing loads of features (like managing circular dependency, making sure each file gets only parsed once, es-modules etc...) but has hopefully given you a good idea on how module bundlers actually work.

In fact, this one works in about 60 lines if you remove all of the source code!

Thanks for reading and I hope you have enjoyed a look into the workings of our simple module bundler!
