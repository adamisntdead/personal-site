Hey! My name is Adam and I am currently a student in [Skerries Community College](http://www.skerriescommunitycollege.ie/), in Dublin.
I do a lot of programming too, and I built a few things like [TermBar](http://termbar.com), 
[Break](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/break), [Medium TOC](https://www.mediumtoc.com/).

I also wrote a few tools, like [QCGPU](https://qcgpu.github.io), [DevMyMac](https://github.com/adamisntdead/DevMyMac).

I spend a lot of time working on things and learning about other things, some of which I will write here, most of which I will [tweet about](https://twitter.com/adamisntdead). Make sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/adamisntdead) too!
